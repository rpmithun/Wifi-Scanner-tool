Creating a web interface for displaying the wifi using esp8266

Wi-Fi Network Scanner with ESP8266

As part of my ethical hacking practice, I developed a Wi-Fi Network Scanner using the ESP8266 module. The tool scans and displays nearby Wi-Fi

networks with the following details:

            *SSID (Network Name)
            *Signal Strength (dBm)
            *Encryption Type
            *MAC Address
            *Channel Information

Key Features:

*Real-time web interface for visualizing network data
*CSV download functionality for offline analysis

Purpose: 
             This project focuses on essential aspects of network reconnaissance, including identifying encryption types and analyzing signal strengths. These are critical skills for penetration testing and network security assessments.

The tool demonstrates the ability to efficiently gather and analyze network data, aiding in overall security evaluation.
